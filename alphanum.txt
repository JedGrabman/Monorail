In this appendix, squares are denoted by a letter and number, which refer to a row and column in the position diagrams (See Figure \ref{fig:alphanum}).
Moves are referred to by the squares where tiles are placed. The orientation of the tiles is forced due to there only being 1 way to complete a path,
which makes this notation unambiguous. Each equivalence class of positions is listed on its own page, with a diagram of a particular position within that class. 
A table is listed below each diagram with the list of all possible moves, what class of positions results from making that move (which is a clickable link to jump to that page of the appendix)
and whether making that move results in a win or loss if both players make no additional mistakes.

Note that because the pages are for equivalence classes of positions, different positions may link to the same page. For example, the positions in Figure \ref{fig:same} are both
of equivalence class 3-L5x. Each section lists one representative position and the moves that can be made in that position. Other positions within the same equivalence class may
also exist and will have different available moves. However, due to the way the equivalence classes are defined, every move for a position in the equivalence class will have
an equivalent move available in the displayed position. A move and its equivalent move may result in different positions, but the different states will be part of the
same equivalence class. This ensures win/loss evaluations are the same for all positions within an equivalence class.

Classes are ordered first by the number of remaining tiles, then alphabetically. See the [Results](#results) section for more details on equivalence class naming conventions.
